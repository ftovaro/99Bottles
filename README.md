# About

This is the implementation of the exercise shown in the book ***99 Bottles of OOP A Practical Guide to Object-Oriented Design*** of Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen.

About the book:

> This book creates a simple solution to the ["99 Bottles of Beer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bottles_of_Beer) song
> problem, and then applies a series of refactorings to improve the
> design of the code.

What of the things I like of the book was using ***Open to extension, close to modification principle*** and ***Liskov Substitution principle*** from **SOLID**.
